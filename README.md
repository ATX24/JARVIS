# Friday ðŸ¤– ðŸ¦œ
Modern AI assistant powered by LangChain

Implements the LangChain OpenAIFunctions Agent

## Abilities  ðŸš€
- Can draft emails, turn on lights, write and compile code, search the web, and work with local files

**Conversation Functionalities**
- Python speech recognition library to get input
- GTTS for response output
- Activates when the user says the wake-word: "Friday" (To customize the wake word, change the condition in the runJarvis function)
  

## LLM Tools ðŸ”¨
- Gmail tool for writing custom email drafts
- Terminal tool for local-env interaction (dangerous)
- IFTTT smart home tool to control lights
- Python_REPL to write and compile code
- Duck Duck Go search tool
- Arxiv tool for referencing scholarly articles




## To Do: 
- [x] Add a custom CSV agent to use as a tool to work with the Strava API. Should be able to analyze run data (find outliers, create summaries, etc.) 
- [ ] Improved memory solution using a vector database to store embeddings
- [ ] Use the new Llama-2 model to eliminate the need for the OpenAI API (in progress)
- [ ] Build a tool that hosts a BabyAGI agent (with the Llama-2 model) for more complex tasks

If the BabyAGI agent is better than the overall agent (and can be equipped with the same tools), we will be switching to BabyAGI
